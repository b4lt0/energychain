## Software Engineering project work

We've developed a _prototype_ for a **blockchain based application**.<br />
It aims to build a _transparent_, _secure_ and **_automated_** market for the exchange of electricity.<br /><br />
### We tought about this scenario: 
1. there is a small plant that has a bio-gas generator and sometimes it makes _more energy than what it can store or use_;<br /><br />
2. the application creates and publish an _announce for this surplus_ at 12 cents on our platform;<br /><br />
3. you have an _house close to the plant_ and you buy electricity for 20 cents per kW/h from the public electricity grid;<br /><br />
4. the smart contract you stipulated on our app sees that _there are some convenient kWs_, available at 12 cents;<br /><br />
5. the application understands this opportunity and creates _a transaction between you and the facility_;<br /><br />
6. (if there are many player similar to you we can implement a _smart contract based auction system_);<br /><br />
7. the transaction is saved on the Ethereum blockchain and _you receive your energy_ by the electricity grid;<br /><br />
8. **you saved money** (8 cents per kW/h, think about that!), **the seller earns it** (12 cents) **and everyone benefits because this energy is not wasted**.<br /><br />

This scenario is extended to every **prosumer**, you can sell if you have a big or small plant, some photovoltaic panels on your roof, an entire photovoltaic park, a wind turbine, a wind park or, we hope not, a petrol or carbon generator.<br />
The **cooperation** between the players will get advantages to each of them in terms of **energy availability**, **money saving** and **environmental sustainability** of the energy production process. 
_Thus in line with the blockchain's ideals._<br />
Our system operates in the margin between who produces and who uses electricity and aims to _minimize wastes_.
